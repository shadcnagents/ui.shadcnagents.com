description: Copy-paste UI components and production-ready AI patterns for building modern applications with the Vercel AI SDK.
---

shadcncloud gives you two things:

1. **UI Components** — beautifully designed, accessible React components you copy into your project
2. **AI Patterns** — production-ready implementations built with the Vercel AI SDK that you can drop into any Next.js app

This is not an npm package. You own the code. Copy what you need, customize it, ship it.

## UI Components

60+ React components built with Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion. Each component is self-contained — no dependency on shadcncloud itself.

```bash
npx shadcn add https://shadcncloud.com/r/texture-button
```

Browse all components in the [component docs](/docs/components/button-group-input-group) or the [registry](/directory).

## AI Patterns

70 production-ready AI implementations organized by what you're building — chat interfaces, agents, tool integrations, workflows, and more.

Each pattern includes:
- **Live preview** — see the pattern running in the browser
- **Full source code** — every file needed to implement it
- **CLI install** — one command to add it to your project

```bash
npx shadcn add https://shadcncloud.com/r/basics-generate-text
```

Browse all patterns at [/patterns](/patterns) or read the [patterns overview](/docs/stacks/overview).

## Quick Start

<Steps>

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install ai @ai-sdk/anthropic
```

### Add a pattern

```bash
npx shadcn add https://shadcncloud.com/r/ai-elements-chat
```

### Use it

```tsx
import { Chat } from "@/components/stacks/chat"

export default function Page() {
  return <Chat />
}
```

</Steps>

## Free vs Pro

Every pattern is marked as **Free** or **Pro**.

- **Free** — 31 patterns with full source code and live previews, no account needed
- **Pro** — 39 additional patterns including chat clones (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok), orchestration patterns, durable workflows, and full example applications

  <AccordionTrigger>
    Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?
  </AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    You own the code. You can customize every line — the styling, the logic, the API calls. No version conflicts, no dependency bloat, no waiting for upstream fixes.

  <AccordionTrigger>
    Which frameworks are supported?
  </AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    UI components work with any React framework — Next.js, Astro, Remix, Vite. AI patterns are built for Next.js with the Vercel AI SDK, but the core logic works anywhere that supports React server components or API routes.
