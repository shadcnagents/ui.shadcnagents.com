description: Copy-paste UI components and production-ready AI stacks for building modern applications with the Vercel AI SDK.
---

shadcnagents gives you two things:

1. **UI Components** — beautifully designed, accessible React components you copy into your project
2. **AI Stacks** — production-ready implementations built with the Vercel AI SDK that you can drop into any Next.js app

This is not an npm package. You own the code. Copy what you need, customize it, ship it.

## UI Components

117+ React components built with Tailwind CSS and motion/react. Each component is self-contained — no dependency on shadcnagents itself.

```bash
npx shadcn add https://shadcnagents.com/r/texture-button
```

Browse all components in the [component docs](/docs/components/button-group-input-group) or the [registry](/directory).

## AI Stacks

100+ production-ready AI implementations organized by what you're building — chat interfaces, agents, tool integrations, workflows, and more.

Each stack includes:
- **Live preview** — see the stack running in the browser
- **Full source code** — every file needed to implement it
- **CLI install** — one command to add it to your project

```bash
npx shadcn add https://shadcnagents.com/r/basics-generate-text
```

Browse all stacks at [/stacks](/stacks) or read the [stacks overview](/docs/stacks/overview).

## Quick Start

<Steps>

### Install dependencies

```bash
npm install ai @ai-sdk/anthropic
```

### Add a stack

```bash
npx shadcn add https://shadcnagents.com/r/ai-elements-chat
```

### Use it

```tsx
import { Chat } from "@/components/stacks/chat"

export default function Page() {
  return <Chat />
}
```

</Steps>

## Free vs Pro

Every stack is marked as **Free** or **Pro**.

- **Free** — 31 stacks with full source code and live previews, no account needed
- **Pro** — 69+ additional stacks including chat clones (ChatGPT, Claude, Grok), orchestration patterns, durable workflows, and full example applications

  <AccordionTrigger>
    Why copy/paste and not packaged as a dependency?
  </AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    You own the code. You can customize every line — the styling, the logic, the API calls. No version conflicts, no dependency bloat, no waiting for upstream fixes.

    Which frameworks are supported?
  </AccordionTrigger>
  <AccordionContent>
    UI components work with any React framework — Next.js, Astro, Remix, Vite. AI stacks are built for Next.js with the Vercel AI SDK, but the core logic works anywhere that supports React server components or API routes.
