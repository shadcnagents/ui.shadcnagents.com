title: Few-Shot Prompting
description: Guide the model's output format and behavior by providing example input-output pairs in the prompt.

Few-shot prompting is the technique of including example input-output pairs in your prompt to guide the model's behavior. Instead of describing what you want, you show it.

## Why Few-Shot?

Zero-shot (just instructions) works for simple tasks. But when you need:
- **Consistent output format** — JSON schemas, specific markdown structures
- **Domain-specific tone** — matching your brand voice, technical writing style
- **Complex transformations** — input → output mappings that are hard to describe

Few-shot prompting gives the model concrete examples to pattern-match against.

## Basic Pattern

```ts
import { generateText } from "ai"
import { anthropic } from "@ai-sdk/anthropic"

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: anthropic("claude-sonnet-4-20250514"),
  system: `You extract structured data from product descriptions.

Here are examples:

Input: "Nike Air Max 90, men's running shoe, $129.99, available in black and white"
Output: {"name": "Nike Air Max 90", "category": "running", "price": 129.99, "colors": ["black", "white"]}

Input: "Adidas Ultraboost 22, women's training shoe, $189.00, comes in pink"
Output: {"name": "Adidas Ultraboost 22", "category": "training", "price": 189.00, "colors": ["pink"]}`,
  prompt: `Input: "New Balance 574, unisex lifestyle shoe, $79.99, grey and navy"`,
})
```

## How Many Examples?

- **2-3 examples** — enough for most formatting tasks
- **5-8 examples** — for nuanced behavior (tone, edge cases)
- **10+** — rarely needed; if you need this many, consider fine-tuning instead

Quality matters more than quantity. Pick examples that cover the edge cases you care about.

## Tips

**Include edge cases.** If empty fields are possible, show an example with an empty field. If the input can be ambiguous, show how to handle it.

**Keep examples diverse.** Don't repeat the same pattern — show the range of inputs the model will see.

**Match the real distribution.** If 80% of inputs are short and 20% are long, your examples should reflect that ratio.

**Order matters slightly.** Put the most representative example first and the trickiest edge case last (recency bias helps).
